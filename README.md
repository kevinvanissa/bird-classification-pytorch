## Overview

The objective of this project is to classify various bird species using a dataset of images. The model utilizes the EfficientNet architecture for feature extraction and classification. The dataset is prepared using a custom `BirdDataset` class that extends PyTorch's `Dataset`.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision timm matplotlib tqdm
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bird-species-classification.git
   cd bird-species-classification
   ```

2. **Prepare your dataset:**
   - Organize your images in a directory structure that matches the requirements of `ImageFolder`.

3. **Run the notebook:**
   - Open the Jupyter notebook and execute the cells to train and evaluate the model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is organized in a directory structure as follows:

```
bird-species/
    └── train/
        └── class_1/
            └── image1.jpg
        └── class_2/
            └── image2.jpg
    └── test/
        └── class_1/
        └── class_2/
```

You can also create a smaller subset of the dataset to facilitate quicker training.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using the EfficientNet B0 architecture from the `timm` library. The architecture includes:

- **Feature Extraction:** The base model is pretrained on ImageNet.
- **Classifier:** A linear layer that maps the features to the number of bird species.

## Training

The training process involves the following steps:

1. Data loading using `DataLoader`.
2. Model training for a specified number of epochs.
3. Monitoring of training and validation loss.

Training is executed using the following code snippet:

```python
for epoch in range(epochs):
    # Training loop
    ...
```

## Testing

After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a test set. Accuracy is calculated using the following function:

```python
def calculate_accuracy(model, data_loader, device):
    ...
```

## Visualization

Training and validation loss over epochs are visualized using Matplotlib:

```python
plt.plot(training_loss, label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(validation_loss, label='Validation Loss')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Loss')
plt.show()
```
